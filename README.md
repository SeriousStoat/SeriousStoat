# Welcome, 
I go by SeriousStoat,  
I would like to become a software engineer.  
This account will archive some of my work to better illustrate my knowledge and skill. 

## About Me
My favorite linux distribution is Debian,  
I prefer function over flash, simple but robust,  
I am a life long learner,  
I like alliteration.
